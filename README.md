</p>

## ✨ Completely Free!

NeoPaste is  **100% free and open source**! We believe in making productivity tools accessible to everyone.

> 🎉 **Coming Soon to the Mac App Store!** We're working on bringing NeoPaste to the Mac App Store for even easier installation and updates.



## 🚀 Key Features

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

At NeoPaste, your privacy and security are our top priorities. Here's how we ensure your data stays safe:

1. **No Clipboard Data Storage**  
   NeoPaste **does not store or log your clipboard data**. All clipboard content is processed locally on your Mac, and once saved as a file, no record of it is kept within the app.

2. **No Outbound Internet Access**  
   To safeguard your privacy, NeoPaste **does not access the internet**. This eliminates any risk of clipboard content being sent or exposed online.

3. **Hardened Runtime & Notarization**  
   NeoPaste is built with the macOS **Hardened Runtime** enabled and is **notarized by Apple**. This ensures that the app is secure, free of malicious code, and fully compliant with macOS security standards.

> 🚨 **Transparency Commitment:** NeoPaste is 100% open source, so you can inspect the code yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/ArioMoniri/NeoPaste) to verify these claims.

If you have any concerns or questions about privacy, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ArioMoniri/NeoPaste/issues) or contact me directly.

> ℹ️ **Note**  
You can help translate this application into your own language! This is an essential step in making NeoPaste accessible to everyone, regardless of their English proficiency. Learn how to contribute by visiting the [Translating NeoPaste](##🌍-translating-neopaste) section.

## 🌍 Translating NeoPaste

### Help Translate NeoPaste into Your Language!

You can make NeoPaste accessible to a wider audience by translating it into your native language. This effort is crucial in ensuring that everyone, regardless of their English proficiency, can benefit from NeoPaste’s features. 

### How to Contribute

### Important Notes Before You Start Translating

1. **HTML Tags**  
   Some strings may contain **HTML tags** (e.g., `<strong>` or `<span>`). Please respect the formatting and copy the tags exactly as they appear in the source text. Modifying or omitting these tags can break the rendering on the website.
2. **Special Character Codes**  
   Certain strings include **special character codes** like `&#8984;` (⌘) or `&RightArrowBar;` (⇥). These codes are essential for proper rendering and accessibility. Hover over them in Crowdin to see what they represent, and ensure they are copied exactly as shown, including the semicolon at the end.
3. **Non-Breaking Spaces**  
   Some strings use **non-breaking spaces** (`&nbsp;`) between words. These are used to prevent unwanted line breaks and maintain proper formatting. Do not replace these with regular spaces; use them as they appear in the source string.
4. **Escaping Quotation Marks**  
   Strings containing **quotation marks** (`"`, `'`) may require escaping with a backslash (`\`) to prevent rendering or runtime errors. Ensure these are escaped properly in your translations.


### 📝 Pro Tips for Translating

- Click on tags in Crowdin to paste them directly into your translation.
- Pay close attention to special characters, tags, and formatting in the source text.
- Avoid introducing new HTML tags or removing the existing ones.

Your contributions are highly valued, and they make NeoPaste more accessible for users worldwide! 🌐✨
